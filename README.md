# IBM_Cloud_Projects
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the most appropriate National Social Assistance Programme (NSAP) scheme for individuals based on their socio-economic data. The project leverages IBM Watson Studio's AutoAI feature to automate the entire ML pipeline, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
